# plotting-stl-file-using-matplotlib-and-mplot3d
This python code will create an interactive plot of a 3d model by extracting it from a xyz.stl file using matplotlib and mpl_toolkits' mplot3d library.

For the interective plot use the 6th cell of the ipynb file.

Note: I have added two sample .stl to run the checkout the code
